# 📦 Final Assignment: Build, Organize, and Deploy a Multipage Website

This project is the **capstone assignment** that brings together everything learned about **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, planning, structure, and deployment**.  
The goal is to **conceptualize, build, and deploy a multi-page website** that is responsive, interactive, and ready for the real world. 🚀

## 🌐🎯 Part 1: Planning and Organizing

Before writing code, the project involves careful planning:

- Define the website’s purpose (e.g., portfolio, product showcase, blog).
- Outline 3–5 pages (such as **Home, About, Services, Contact, Gallery**).
- Sketch or describe the layout of each page.
- Map out the navigation flow between pages.

**🎯 Goal:** Show intentional structure and create a smooth user journey.

## 🌍💻 Part 2: Building the Website

The site is built with:

- **HTML5** → Semantic structure
- **CSS3** → Responsive layouts, styling, and animations
- **JavaScript** → Interactivity (menus, forms, toggles, dynamic content)

Each page includes:

- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ A consistent header and footer
- ✅ At least one interactive feature (e.g., form validation, toggle menu, scroll animation)

**🎯 Goal:** Combine all learned skills into a cohesive, functioning project.

## 🛠️🚀 Part 3: Code Organization

To ensure the project is **production-friendly**, the following best practices are applied:

- Organized file structure (`/css`, `/js`, `/images`, etc.)
- Clean, modular, and well-commented code
- Meaningful file names and relative paths
- Validation of HTML/CSS and testing across devices

**🎯 Goal:** Make the codebase readable, maintainable, and scalable.

## 🌐🚀 Part 4: Hosting and Deployment

The final project is deployed online using one of the following platforms:

- **GitHub Pages** → Great for portfolios and static sites
- **Netlify** → Easy CI/CD features and form support
- **Vercel** → Fast deployment for frontend projects

Deployment checklist:
